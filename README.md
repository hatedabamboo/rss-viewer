The RSS Viewer is a straightforward, single-page application designed to demonstrate the capabilities of deploying applications with [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). This tool showcases the ease and flexibility of setting up, managing, and scaling applications in the cloud, making it an accessible option for developers looking to streamline deployment and testing processes.

The application is built using the React framework, as AWS Amplify currently supports deployment of JavaScript-based applications. This choice leverages React's component-based architecture, which aligns well with Amplifyâ€™s deployment and management capabilities, enabling a smooth development and deployment workflow.

This application displays RSS feeds from a provided link in a visually appealing format. Its functionality is intentionally simple and limited to feed viewing. For features like feed subscription, customization, or advanced content organization, consider using more comprehensive tools like Feedly.
